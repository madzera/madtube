## About the MadTube

MadTube is a small learning project, overly simple with the sole purpose of practicing the Dart programming language along with the Flutter framework. Specifically, I created this project to practice asynchronous programming in Dart using widgets like FutureBuilder. Additionally, this project use a third-party lib to render the YouTube videos called **youtube_player_flutter**.

## User Guide
There are 5 functionalities (with only one made until now and I think that I won't continue =( ).
